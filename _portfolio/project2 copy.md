Producer of the film must know public pulse of the film (right after release) by analysing movie tweets, so he can maximize or minimize the ticket rate based on the response. After the gathering tweets, we clean the data, featurize the training data and classify each training tweet into either positive or negative or neutral based on number of positive, negative words. Then classify the remaining tweets by using below mentioned algorithm and select the final one based on better accuracy.
