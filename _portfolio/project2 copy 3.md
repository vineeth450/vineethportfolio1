Worked on Endurance-Aware Cache Line Management for Non-Volatile Caches, Non- Volatile caches have low standby power, high density and limited write endurance. Classic cache management policies donâ€™t consider write endurance of cache. We proposed SET CMP (Secure Error Tolerant Cache Management Policy) technique which improves lifespan by wear-levelling techniques and defend caches against security threats like **Repeated Address Attack (RAA)**.
