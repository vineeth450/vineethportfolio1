Breast cancer is growing problem among women, knowing the stage of it is a must and treated accordingly. Here, by using the Classification algorithms, we can classify the tumor as Benign or Malignant. The tumor is considered to be benign if the cells that are developing out of control are normal cells (noncancerous). The tumor is classified as malignant if the out-of-control cells are abnormal and do not behave like the body's normal cells (cancerous). In 2020, an estimated 3,676,262 women in the United States were diagnosed with female breast cancer. Here, by using the Classification algorithms, we can classify the tumor as Benign or Malignant. Itâ€™s a binary classification problem.
